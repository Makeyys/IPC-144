1) One of the advantages of using structs instead of parallel arrays in that you can represent multiple data items of same types by using only a single name. You are able to store and access these elements at any given time when coding. 
2) The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is to write struct and declare the name of the structure. When coding the name, it is recommended that the name of the struct must be capitalized such as Student or Neighbourhood. Then, the user can list the members of the data type such as int, char and long types. After the user declares the data types as 0, they can store and display information within these data types.
