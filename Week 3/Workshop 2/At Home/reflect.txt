1. The most important thing I learned this week was the use of modulus combined with integer values and how I can use them together to create a program. I also learned and gained an insight on how to covert between float and integer values that I believe will play a big role for me in the future. 
2. You must add 0.005 when calculating GTS owing because it takes 1.1284 and helps the program to round the GST to 1.13 easier.
3. The result of a casting brand is the conversion of one operand to another or converting one expression to another.
4. I believe that I was required to use the modulus operator in this workshop because in languages such as C++ and Java, the modulus operator is used frequently in the math sections of programming to calculate the remainder. This is very important in the business aspect of coding.
