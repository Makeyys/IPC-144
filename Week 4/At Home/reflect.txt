1)	Name all the iteration constructs.

The three iterations used in my code was while, do while and for

2)	In two or three sentences explain the difference between a “do while” and a “while” loop?

A while statement executes the sequence when the code is true however, it will not run the sequence if 
the sequence is false. 

A do while statement executes the sequence once and continues to run the program as long as the 
condition is true. If the condition is false, it will exit the loop and display an error message until the 
sequence is found true. 

A for statement breaks down it’s initialization, change and condition sections by a semi colon. This 
statement is almost like a while statement, it will repeat its sequence only when the condition is true.

3)	In two or three sentences explain what is meant by the term conditional expression?

Conditional Expressions is a construct in which the programmer can create alternate paths that the user 
can encounter based on their condition. An example other than iteration constructs is if statements. If 
the user does not meet a condition on a if statement, it will bring the user into another section of the 
code.
